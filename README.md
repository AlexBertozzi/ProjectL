Small game

Don't build with makefile
    Currently using it to store the compiling string, still don't know how to execute it with make

To compile and run use Compile.bat
    It will compile and run all automatically
    You can run it with cmd by just typing Compile

All dll must be in the same folder as the .exe, as currently (I think)

Framerate is not capped, wait next update to try it.
